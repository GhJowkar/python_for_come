# Tutorial: Python for Computational Molecular Evolutionary Tasks

In this file, I provided Python scripts for working with biological sequences and phylogenetic trees. 
This tutorial assumes you are familiar with basic bioinformatic tasks and their extension to computational evolutionary models.

### Requirments
For this tutorial, you should already have Python 3.9 or higher, jupyter notebook along with the following libraries:

'''numpy, ete3, biopython and pandas'''


## Lesson 1: Basics Sequence tasks

Shows how to load sequence data and perform simple data structure tasks.

## Lesson 2: Basics tree tasks

Shows how to load phylogenetic tree and perform simple data structure tasks.

## Lesson 3: Visualizing reconstructed ancestors using ARPIP

Visualizing posterior probability profile, indel points and etc.

## Lesson Bonus 

Converting existing exchangalbility matrices to generator 'Q' matrix for WAG and LG models.
